# Users

**Let's walk through our first module which is the users module. This is where you can create users for our app and can set specific role for them in the app.**

So if you are logged into the app you see all the options under the user navigation. 
1. Can View all the user registered into our app
2. Can add New Admin 
3. Can add Customers
